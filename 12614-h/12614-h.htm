    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>A Brass-hat employed at the Air Ministry recently requested
    that his salary might be reduced on the ground that there was
    now very little work for him to do. As no other symptoms
    developed, the close observation kept upon him has now been
    relaxed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>To what extent the habit of war economy is embedded in the
    minds of the British public was illustrated at Woodford Green
    on March 29th, when a lady entered the local Post Office and
    endeavoured to purchase some Daylight Saving Certificates.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The War Office Staff, it was stated in the House of Commons,
    has been reduced from 21,807 to 19,510 since the Armistice. It
    is only fair to point out that the vast bulk of them were not
    asked whether they wanted an Armistice.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The War Office talks of re-issuing to the Volunteers the
    rifles and equipment which were long ago called in. This threat
    is likely to discourage many of them from volunteering for the
    next Peace.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Experiments are being conducted with the view of discovering
    the best use to which obsolete army tanks can be put. Attached
    to a piece of cheese they are said to make excellent
    mouse-traps.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The police," says <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>&agrave;
    propos</i> of the escape of twenty Sinn Feiners from Mountjoy
    prison, "are pursuing active inquiries." This is much simpler
    than pursuing active Sinn Feiners.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Ever since the snowdrop gave the first hint of Spring,"
    burbles a contemporary, "we have watched the miracle of the
    young year unfolding." It certainly <i>was</i> a miracle in the
    weather we had last week.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The suggestion is being put forward in certain quarters
    that, in order to save time, the Commission to fix the
    responsibility for the Peace should begin to sit at once.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is not known definitely how many ex-munition workers in
    this country are at present in Government unemployment.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In connection with the recent report that the Sittinghurst
    Vermin Club had killed 1,175 mice in one day, we are asked to
    say that the number should be 1,176. It appears that one mouse
    made its way in a state of collapse to the Club headquarters
    and gave itself up.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>From the newspapers we gather that a sample of water
    analysed by the Essex County Analyst contained seven per cent.
    of milk.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A man charged with burglary in Hoxton Street was captured in
    a meat-storage ice-house. It is said that, remembering a
    well-known precedent, he tried to evade capture by making a
    noise like a frozen Canterbury lamb.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sir SAMUEL SCOTT says that the odds are that a quack will
    kill you quicker than a qualified doctor. All the same we
    prefer the slow-and-sure method.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the Bishop of MANCHESTER there is a shortage of
    curates. A spinster writes to say that she is not surprised,
    considering how quickly they get snapped up.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With reference to the burglar who made off with the jewels
    of ex-Queen AMELIE, it is said that the fellow contemplates in
    future styling himself on his visiting-cards as "Housebreaker
    to the ex-Queen of Portugal."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A weekly paper states that if every soldier who served in
    France during the War would place all the letters he had
    received in a line they would reach a little more than once
    round the world. We hear, however, that, as the present
    addresses of several demobilised men are unknown, the feat will
    not be attempted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Between ten and fifteen thousand years ago," says Professor
    KEITH, "Scotland became fit for habitation." We ourselves
    should not have assigned so remote a date to the introduction
    of whisky into that country.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"There is no place like home," says a gossip-writer. This
    seems to indicate that spring cleaning has started at his
    residence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"It isn't every year we celebrate peace," says a
    correspondent in a weekly paper. The usual custom, of course,
    is to celebrate peace about once every war.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"A Pretty Way to Pat Butter" is the heading of one of a
    contemporary's "Household Hints." They will never improve on
    the old-fashioned custom of slapping it heartily on the
    bread.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"People will be able to have their strawberries and cream
    this summer," said an official of the Food Ministry the other
    day. Still, for association's sake it is thought that the
    conventional description, "Marrows and Milk," will be retained
    on the menus.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Professor LEONARD HILL says that people working in gas
    factories who have to breathe poison fumes suffer less from
    influenza than anyone else. It is thought that this opinion may
    give a serious set-back to the Garden City movement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Hens like artificial light," says Professor RICE, of
    Cornell University, "and if provided with it will lay through
    the winter." One enterprising gas company, we understand, is
    already advertising that no fowl-house can be regarded as
    adequately furnished without its egg-in-the-slot meter.</p>

    <h2>TO-DAY IN THE FOOD GARDEN.</h2>

    <p>PEAS.&mdash;Have you planted your early peas yet? If not you
    should do so at once. Select a piece of well-tilled ground
    running North and South. To find the North go out at twelve
    o'clock and stand facing the direction you think the sun would
    be in if it were visible. Turn smartly about bringing up the
    left foot on the word "Two." If you guessed right the first
    time you will now be facing North. Without taking your eye off
    it, drill your peas into the ground in columns of fours. Don't
    forget to soak them in prussic acid or any simple poison (this
    is done more easily before they are sown) to prevent them being
    eaten by mice. A less effective precaution is to sit up all
    night near the vegetable garden and miaow.</p>

    <p>Here is a good recipe for cooking peas. Shell the peas. Take
    a piece of butter as big as a nut, two ducklings, six ounces
    sage and onions and three drops of mushroom catsup. Roast
    together briskly for twenty minutes. Boil the peas for fifteen
    minutes. Serve together.</p>

    <p>ONIONS.&mdash;The big, gentle onions seen in the shops can
    only be brought to maturity on very warm sandy soil. Most of
    them come from Portugal. How the natives can bear to part with
    them is a mystery. The small high-powered onions, on the other
    hand, are easily cultivated. The best varieties are Eau de
    Jazz, Cook's Revenge, Sutton's Saucepan Corroder and Soho
    Violet. Sow in rows and beat the soil flat with the back of a
    spade. Your neighbour's spade is as good as any other for this
    purpose. Goats are said to be very fond of onion tops, but many
    people hesitate to keep both.</p>

    <p>PARSNIPS.&mdash;To get big parsnips plant a single row
    twenty feet long. Thin out to ten feet apart. The crop you will
    get will last you until the following year. Placed in a quiet
    corner of the potting-shed and covered with sand it will last
    for several years. To get the best out of parsnips stew them in
    a <i>bain-marie</i> for eight hours. Remove the undissolved
    portion of the parsnips and set the liquid on the stone floor
    of the larder to cool. Prepare a nice thick stock, adding
    seasoning to taste. Cut up three carrots. Place the carrots in
    the saucepan in which the parsnips were cooked, being careful
    to wash it out first. Add the stock, bring to a boil and
    serve.</p>

    <p>A LADY-FRIEND sends me the following instructions for
    growing vegetable marrows: In the sunniest part of the
    garden&mdash;the middle of the tennis-court is as good as
    anywhere else&mdash;dig a trench ten feet deep and about six
    wide, taking care to keep the top soil separate from the
    subsoil. Into this trench tip about six hundredweight of a
    compost made up of equal parts of hyperphosphate of lime,
    ground bones, nitrate of soda and basic-slag. The basic-slag
    should be obtained direct from the iron-foundry. That kept by
    the chemist is not always fresh. Add one chive, one cardamon,
    two cloves, half a nutmeg and salt to taste. Replace the
    top-soil. Top-soil and sub-soil can easily be distinguished in
    the following way. If it is on your whiskers it is top-soil, if
    on your boots sub-soil. In the middle of the bed set a good
    strong marrow seedling, root downwards. As it grows remove all
    the marrows except the one you wish to develop. When it stands
    about two hands high, thread a piece of worsted through it,
    allowing the end of the worsted to hang in a pail of water.
    Some gardeners recommend whisky-and-water. If the marrow is
    intended for exhibition a half-inch pipe connected with the
    water main may be substituted for the worsted as soon as the
    marrow is about six feet long. Make a muslin bag out of a pair
    of drawing-room curtains and enclose the marrow in it. This
    will protect it from mosquitoes. As soon as the marrow ceases
    growing or if it becomes sluggish and exhibits loss of appetite
    it is ready for the table. Marrows grown in this way make
    delicious orange-marmalade.</p>

    <p>HOW TO GET RID OF SLUGS.&mdash;Take a piece of hose-pipe
    about forty feet long. Lay one end anywhere and the other on
    the lawn. At the latter end place some cabbage leaves fried in
    bacon fat. The slugs will be attracted by the cabbage leaves
    and, having eaten their fill, will enter the hose-pipe to rest.
    Now hold the hose-pipe perpendicularly over a pail of water and
    pour into it a few drops of chloroform. This will cause the
    slugs to faint and relax their hold. They will then fall
    through the pipe into the water and be drowned. ALGOL.</p>

    dates, stamps and signatures, and that there was no difficulty
    in recognising its validity if a pass had the right British
    official stamp and so long as the signature underneath was one
    of the twenty-four people authorised to sign (a list of which
    would be kept in every sentry-box and constantly revised), and
    if the number of the pass, the name of the person, his address,
    destination, habits, hobbies and past life tallied exactly with
    the information on his "personal Ausweis," which must be
    produced except in the case of a licence to proceed by bicycle,
    which differed, of course, in colour, shape, size and other
    small details (which would have to be learnt by heart) from the
    licence to carry foodstuffs&mdash;in spite, also, of the fact
    that all necessary details of the examination of passes were
    typewritten in not more than three pages of the clearest
    official language and were posted up in every
    sentry-box&mdash;even then that ass Nijinsky let the whole
    company down by passing a member of the Intelligence Police
    through the line on his giving his word of honour that it was
    all right.</p>

    <p>The result was, of course, that I received official
    intimation that our line could apparently be broken at any time
    and that "steps must be taken," etc., etc. I took steps in the
    direction of Nijinsky.</p>

    <p>Nijinsky is a Polish Jew (from Commercial Road, E.) and has
    long been the despair of his platoon sergeant. He is fat where
    there is no need to be fat, his clothes bulge where no clothes
    are expected to bulge, and he is the kind of man who loses a
    cap-badge once a week, preferably just before the C.O. comes
    round. There is only one saving grace about him. He can always
    be trusted to volunteer for a dull lecture or outing to which
    nobody else wants to go, but to which certain numbers have to
    be sent. His invariable reply to the question is, "Yiss, I'll
    ger-go, it's ser-something for ner-nothing."</p>

    <p>I found him, as I expected, hanging round the cookhouse, and
    taxed him with his neglect of duty.</p>

    <p>"He ter-told me I ought to use my dis-cretion, Sir," he
    piped in his high plaintive voice.</p>

    <p>I told him severely that it was a trick, a very palpable
    trick, and that he must ever be on the alert for all such kinds
    of evasion. Finally, when I had informed him how badly he had
    let us all down, he waddled away contrite and tearful, and
    fully under the impression, I think, that I should probably
    lose my commission through his negligence.</p>

    <p>I did not realise how deeply he had taken the matter to
    heart until I found him at his post apparently reading the Riot
    Act to a crowd of obsequious Huns, who were listening patiently
    to the written law as expounded in Yiddish&mdash;that being a
    language in which he succeeds in making himself partially
    understood. The incident passed, but I began to have fears that
    the reformed rake might prove a greater danger than ever.</p>

    <p>The next day my worst fears were realised. In fact, during
    my temporary <span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"
       id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span> absence Nijinsky surpassed
       himself. At eleven o'clock the General, supported by his
       Staff, rolled up in his car and stopped at Nijinsky's post
       on his way into "neutral" country. The General, the G.S.O.1,
       the D.A.Q.M.G. and the A.D.C. got out, shining, gorgeous and
       beflowered with foreign decorations, to chat to the sentry
       (you've seen pictures of it; it's always being done),
       Nijinsky, who had already turned back two innocuous Gunner
       Colonels (armed with sporting guns) that morning, sauntered
       up, drunk with newly acquired confidence, his rifle slung on
       his right shoulder and his hat over one eye.</p>

    <p>"All well here, sentry?" asked the General, towering over
    him in all his glory.</p>

    <p>"Pup-pass, please," said Nijinsky, ever on the look-out for
    some cunning trick.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's all right; I'm General Blank."</p>

    <p>The word "General" recalled Nijinsky to his senses. He
    unslung his rifle, brought it to the order, brought it to the
    slope and presented arms with great solemnity, and as only
    Nijinsky can.</p>

    <p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;stand easy," said the General, when the
    meaning of these evolutions was made manifest to him.
    "Wonderful days for you fellows here&mdash;what? There have
    been times when the Rhine seemed a long way away, didn't it?
    And now here you are, a victorious army guarding that very
    river! It's a wonderful time for you, and no doubt you
    appreciate it?"</p>

    <p>"Ger-grub's short," said Nijinsky.</p>

    <p>"Rations?" said the D.A.Q.M.G. "I've had no complaints."</p>

    <p>"Yiss. No spuds&mdash;taters, I mean."</p>

    <p>"We must see to that," said the General. "Well, we'll go on,
    I think;" and they got into the car.</p>

    <p>"Pup-pass, please," said Nijinsky, spotting the trick at
    once.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's all right, my good fellow. Drive on."</p>

    <p>"N-n-no," said Nijinsky sternly; "you ker-can't ger-go
    without a pup-pup-pass!"</p>

    <p>"Come, come, don't be ridiculous. I'm your General; you know
    me perfectly well."</p>

    <p>"Yiss."</p>

    <p>"Then let me through, do you hear? And let me have no more
    of this infernal nonsense."</p>

    <p>"It's ug-ug&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"It's what?"</p>

    <p>"Ug-against orders."</p>

    <p>"<i>I</i> know all about the orders, boy. I gave them
    myself."</p>

    <p>"Yiss, and I'm ker-carrying them out, ain't I?" came with
    inexorable logic.</p>

    <p>"Well, now I give you orders to let me through. Do you
    see?"</p>

    <p>"Yiss; but if I do they'll have me up for disobeying the
    fer-first one. Pup-pass, please."</p>

    <p>"Don't be ridiculous. We <i>must</i> go through. Don't you
    realise we have our duty to perform?"</p>

    <p>"Yiss, Sir, so have I."</p>

    <p>"'Pon my soul, this is too preposterous. My good boy, I'm
    very glad you know how to obey an order, but you must use your
    discretion sometimes."</p>

    <p>At the word "discretion" Nijinsky started. Then he broke all
    records and winked&mdash;winked at a perfectly good General at
    eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no, you der-don't," he grinned; "I've been her-had
    before. The Captain says I'm ner-not to use my discretion; it
    only ger-gets me into a lot of terouble."</p>

    <p>The General got out of his car. So
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"
       id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> did the G.S.O.1. So did the
       D.A.Q.M.G. So did the A.D.C. But the spectacle was not so
       impressive as before. They advanced in artillery formation
       upon the enemy. It was enough. Perish the General Staff!
       They were mere phantoms of authority beside the vision of
       the company officer and the words, "Escort and
       accused&mdash;halt. Left&mdash;turn. Private Nijinsky, Sir."
       With his eyes bulging with excitement Nijinsky leapt back
       and assumed the attitude of warlike defiance known as
       "coming on guard."</p>

    <p>The General hesitated. He did not know Nijinsky, you see; he
    had never seen him going sick before the battle, or heard him
    murmur "ser-something for ner-nothing," as he took his
    medicine.</p>

    <p>"Look here, my man, you are exceeding your duty and the
    consequences will be very serious. I will <i>not</i> be stopped
    in this outrageous manner! There is a time to <i>obey</i>
    orders and there is a time to <i>use our discretion</i>.
    Confound it, we must <i>all</i> of us use our discretion at
    times."</p>

    <p>"Then," said Nijinsky, "wer-will you per-please use yours,
    for. I ker-can't let you through without a pup-pass."</p>

    <p>The sun shone brightly on the car as it retired
    ignominiously, leaving Nijinsky hot, happy and victorious,
    presenting arms faithfully to the indignant Great Ones, and
    silence reigned on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>He came and spluttered it all out to me afterwards,
    concluding with "I der-didn't let the ker-company down this
    time, Sir, der-did I?" and evidently expected a pat on the back
    for it.</p>

    <p>Teams of infuriated artillery horses wouldn't drag from me
    whether he got it or not, but from that day to this he has
    never looked back. Indeed he has begun to take a pride in his
    personal appearance and general smartness. I met him yesterday
    wearing a smile like a slice of melon and with his boots, and
    buttons glistening in the sunshine.</p>

    <p>"The General came through to-day, Sir," he said, beaming,
    "and he her-had a pup-pass all right;" and he strutted on,
    making strange noises in his throat, which I understand is the
    Yiddish for being pleased with yourself.</p>

    <h2>GETTING A JOB.</h2>

    <p>John looked very gloomy.</p>

    <p>"<i>Pourquoi triste</i>, John?" said I, knowing the
    language.</p>

    <p>"Well, it's like this," said John, "the time has come when
    you and I must look for a job."</p>

    <p>"That's all right," said I cheerfully. "We'll go and see the
    Advisory Committee. They'll put us up to a job in civil life.
    They're sitting there bubbling over with advice. Employers in
    England are simply falling over one another to find positions
    for brave young officers who&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I don't think," remarked John very sceptically. "I
    went to see the Advisory Committee two days ago. Perhaps I was
    rather unfortunate in arriving at the same time as the English
    mail; anyhow I came away with the following information and
    convictions:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1) That the easiest job in civil life is to sit on an
    Advisory Committee.</p>

    <p>(2) That one is always either too old or too young for the
    Civil Services.</p>

    <p>(3) That I was a devil of a good fellow and I'd won the War
    (they patted me on the back and told me so).</p>

    <p>(4) That I was to fill up my A.Z.15 and trust in my stars
    (not the things on my sleeve)."</p>

    <p>"Well, what about it?" I continued.</p>

    <p>"Personally," said John, "I think an advertisement in <i>The
    Daily Telegraph</i> is the correct thing. How's
    this?&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'Anybody know of a decent war? Two young subs in France,
    Soldiers of Fortune (so-called), would like to get in touch
    with anyone thinking of starting a first-class war. Send full
    particulars and rough strength of enemy to "Warriors," c/o
    <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.'"</p>

    <p>Mine was much more modest:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"An officer at present in France desires a good job in civil
    life. No experience, no education, no languages, no money, no
    prospects and no hope. What offers?"</p>

    <p>"I don't think they'll bring much," said I. "You know, John,
    what we really want is leave."</p>

    <p>So we applied for leave.</p>

    <p>John asked permission to remove his person to the U.K. for
    urgent and private reasons. I stated that I had a position
    offered me, but an interview was necessary, and asked their
    indulgence for the purpose.</p>

    <p>John's chit came back three days later. "Will this officer
    state his urgent and private reasons, please?"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said John, "enemy attitude hostile." Nevertheless he
    stated as required.</p>

    <p>Three days later it came back again with the request that
    this officer further state his reasons, please.</p>

    <p>"Enemy attitude distinctly hostile," said John, and
    committed himself further.</p>

    <p>Nothing happened for a week and John's hopes ran high. "It
    must be through, old man," he declared, "or it would have been
    back before now."</p>

    <p>But when at the end of the week it came back for further
    information his ardour cooled somewhat, and when, three days
    later, it turned up once more with a request for his urgent and
    private reasons, John in a fit of exasperation retorted that if
    the matter was kept much longer it wouldn't be urgent, and if
    they enquired much further it wouldn't be private. That
    finished him, and he got no leave.</p>

    <p>My application was still on the tapis. Eventually it
    returned. "This officer can be granted leave only on condition
    that he promises to serve with the Rhine Army."</p>

    <p>"Go on," said John; "promise."</p>

    <p>So I promised.</p>

    <p>Now, looking over the situation, we find that it amounts to
    this: John has no job and never will have till he can get leave
    to look for one. He can't get leave. That's John.</p>

    <p>I have a job (I haven't really) if I can get leave to attend
    an interview. I've got leave, but only on the understanding
    that when I've got the job I refuse it because I've promised to
    serve on the Rhine. That's me.</p>

    <p>We are now thinking out the next move.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR MRS. BONNAMY,&mdash;I am glad to report that my
    journey was accomplished in safety and comparative comfort.
    Indeed my housekeeper was surprised that I showed so few traces
    of fatigue. This, I tell her, was due to the kind care and
    consideration experienced by me throughout my sojourn beneath
    your hospitable roof.</p>

    <p>Please inform Miss Chance that the carriage <i>was</i> a
    through one. This may relieve her of any possible anxiety as to
    her own journey with her mother. I much appreciated her
    consideration in seeing me into the train, and trust that the
    weather will prove favourable for their return to town.</p>

    <p>Although the week I passed in your society will always be an
    agreeable memory it carries with it the penalty of an increased
    sense of my solitary life, and I feel that your remarks were
    not without justice.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR MRS. MAYNE CHANCE,&mdash;Ever since my return from
    the visit which gave me so much happiness in your society and
    that of your dear daughter, I have wondered whether I dared
    address you upon a point which concerns me intimately. Have you
    reason to suppose that her affections are engaged in any
    quarter? Believe me that I seek this information from no idle
    curiosity, but solely that I may know whether there is any
    obstacle to my making a certain proposal. I naturally shrink
    from intruding myself between a mother and daughter whose
    companionship is so close and am well aware of the disparity in
    our ages, but if you could encourage me to proceed you would
    confer the greatest happiness upon a very lonely man.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR MR. CRABBE HERMITAGE,&mdash;Your letter has come as
    the greatest surprise. I suppose mothers cannot expect to keep
    for ever at their daughters' side, but the parting is robbed of
    its bitterness when <i>other</i> considerations are
    involved.</p>

    <p>I questioned the dear child this morning and she confessed,
    as indeed I suspected, that she is not indifferent to the
    attentions of the son of a neighbour of ours. But anyhow there
    need be no obstacle in that quarter. She is far too sensible
    and unselfish, as only I know. Surely there is not such a
    disparity of age as you seem to think! But perhaps I have said
    too much.</p>

    days ago to endeavour to ascertain whether you would view
    favourably the proposal which I wished to make. Her reply was,
    on the whole, encouraging, but it is far from being my wish
    that in seeking my own happiness you should sacrifice your own.
    More I will not permit myself to add until you have reassured
    my mind.</p>

    about it, and I think it is perfectly lovely. Of course I would

    <h2>A GENTLE HINT.</h2>

    <p>The Corps Commander paced thoughtfully down the street of a
    half-ruined village in France and his thoughts were pleasant;
    for he alone amongst all other Corps Commanders was the owner
    of a cow. There was no other cow in the whole army nearer than
    G.H.Q., and he pictured the envy of brother Generals when he
    invited them to come in and have a glass of milk.</p>

    <p>The Assistant Provost-Marshal stood at his office window and
    gazed out upon his garden. His thoughts were also pleasant, for
    the garden belonged to him by right of billet law, and in the
    garden grew strawberries rich and ripe.</p>

    <p>The A.P.M. pictured the envy of brother A.P.M.'s when he
    should ask them to a strawberry feast.</p>

    <p>The Corps Commander's thoughtful wanderings took him by
    chance through the A.P.M.'s garden, and as he walked he stooped
    now and again and picked some of the sacred fruit.</p>

    <p>The A.P.M. swelled with impotent anger, for the Corps
    Commander was known to be "hot stuff," and nobody had told him
    "not to do it" for a very long time.</p>

    <p>That night the A.P.M. sought the company of his friend the
    R.E. officer and told his troubles.</p>

    <p>The R.E. officer had been a journalist before the War and
    had learnt to say and write rude things without offence. He was
    also the owner of wood and paint and brushes.</p>

    <p>The next morning a large notice-board reared its head above
    the scarlet fruit of the strawberry bed:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>ANYONE FOUND PICKING THESE STRAWBERRIES WILL HAVE HIS
        COW SHOT.</p>

        Lausanne, the Simpleton, Milan, Trieste and beyond. The
        first train is fixed to leave Paris on April
        15."&mdash;<i>Provincial Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"All Fools' Day" would have been more appropriate for the
    "Simpleton" route.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The following advertisement appeared in a French provincial
    paper:&mdash;</p>

        for any people and it is very good and not dear.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, March 31st.</i>&mdash;Colonel WILLIAM THORNE has
    the credit of eliciting from the Government the most hopeful
    statement about Peace which has yet been made. To the hon. and
    gallant Member's suggestion that May 1st should be declared a
    general holiday, if Peace was signed before that date, Mr.
    BONAR LAW replied that it would be considered.</p>

    <p>It is fortunate that the PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE
    BOARD OF TRADE possesses a most imperturbable character. He is
    daily bombarded with the most diverse questions regarding the
    effects of the Government's fiscal policy. The paper
    manufacturers are being ruined because paper is being allowed
    in; export traders are suffering because glass bottles are kept
    out; the textile trades cannot compete with their foreign
    rivals because of the high price of olive-oil. But for all
    inquirers Mr. BRIDGEMAN has a soft answer, delivered in level
    tones, discouraging further catechism.</p>

    <p>A delightful inconsistency is one of Lord HENRY
    CAVENDISH-BENTINCK'S many claims upon the affection of the
    House. Not long ago he wrote a book in praise of Toryism as a
    democratic creed; so it was perfectly natural that when Mr.
    CECIL HARMSWORTH (a Coalition Liberal) had explained that law
    and order must be restored before an inquiry could usefully be
    held into the causes of the Egyptian riots Lord HENRY should
    burst out with, "When will my hon. friend begin to apply
    Liberal principles?"</p>

    <p>Mr. BOTTOMLEY is the latest convert to "P.R.," as the result
    of a mock-election in which he came out top of the poll, with
    the PRIME MINISTER second, Mr. HOGGE third, and Messrs. BALFOUR
    and ASQUITH among the "also ran;" but Mr. BONAR LAW, who can be
    very dense when he likes, did not see in that an argument for
    the general adoption of the system.</p>

    <p>The "Wee Frees" made a last and unavailing attempt to defeat
    the new Military Service Bill. Mr. GEORGE THORNE, Major HAYWARD
    and others made great play with the PRIME MINISTER'S "No
    Conscription" pledge, and Mr. NEWBOULD in a maiden speech
    declared that what West Leyton had said yesterday England would
    say to-morrow. But it was noticeable that not one of the
    opponents of the Bill was unwilling to give the Government the
    powers they required if they were really necessary.</p>

    <p>Mr. CHURCHILL revealed himself in a new <i>r&ocirc;le</i> as
    a financier, and proved to his own satisfaction that the Army
    Estimates of &pound;506,500,000 would, if properly manipulated,
    work out at little more than a fourth of that amount. Between
    now and the Budget Mr. CHAMBERLAIN might do worse than get his
    versatile colleague to explain away the National Debt.</p>

        <h3>THE PROMISE OF MAY.</h3><i>Peace</i>. "IF YOU'RE
        WAKING, CALL ME EARLY, CALL ME EARLY, BONAR DEAR, FOR I'M
        TO BE QUEEN OF THE MAY, BONAR; I'M TO BE QUEEN OF THE MAY."
    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday, April 1st</i>.&mdash;Twenty years ago there used
    to be a not infrequent headline in <i>The Times</i>, "The Duke
    of Devonshire on Technical Education," which always struck on
    my frivolous spirit with a touch of infinite prose. It is the
    same nowadays, I regret to say, with a Lords' debate on the
    national resources. The Upper House is filled with eminent
    financiers&mdash;men who think in millions and who under our
    glorious Constitution may not propose an expenditure of
    sixpence without the consent of Tom, Dick and Harry in the
    Commons&mdash;and they all talk the most excellent good sense.
    But whether such unimpeachable truisms as that "this huge Debt
    is going to be a terrible handicap to this country" (Lord
    LANSDOWNE), or that "what applies to private credit and private
    economy may be in the main taken to apply to public economy and
    also to public credit" (Lord CREWE), are going to have much
    effect upon the demands of the Labour Party, to whom they were
    directly addressed, I am rather inclined to doubt.</p>

    <p>It is refreshing to note, however, that the Commons had a
    brief spasm of economy. Under the financial resolution of the
    Ways and Communications Bill the new Minister would have had
    almost unlimited powers of initiating great enterprises without
    the consent of Parliament. Mr. R.J. MCNEILL alluded (without
    acknowledgment to Mr. Punch) to the hero <i>Eric; or, Little by
    Little</i>, and urged that not even "a Napoleon of
    administration" ought to be trusted with a blank cheque. He
    rather spoilt a good case by referring to the new Minister's
    financial relations with his late employers, the North-Eastern
    Railway; but his argument was so far successful that Mr. BONAR
    LAW undertook first that a Treasury watchdog should be
    permanently installed in the new Ministry, with instructions to
    bark whenever he saw any sign of extravagance; and, secondly,
    that the Minister should not have power to initiate any
    enterprise involving large expenditure&mdash;he suggested a
    million as a moderate limit&mdash;without the direct sanction
    of Parliament.</p>

    <p>After this achievement Members felt that a rest was
    necessary. So the Housing Bill was postponed, and after two or
    three Scottish Bills had received a second reading the House
    counted itself out, and Members went to their dinners feeling
    as comfortably virtuous as the Boy Scout who has done his good
    deed for the day.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 2nd</i>.&mdash;The unemployment donation
    was the theme of innumerable inquiries. The MINISTER OF LABOUR
    was forced to admit that Parliament had at present furnished
    him with no direct authority to spend a million or so a week on
    this form of out-door relief, but hoped that it would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"
       id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span> be kind enough to do so
       when the Appropriation Bill came along. A statement that in
       Ireland men were coming for their donation in motorcars
       aroused the sympathy of Mr. JACK JONES, who said that surely
       they were entitled to an occasional ride, but did not go so
       far as to suggest that the Government should organise a
       service of cars to be at their disposal.</p>

    <p>A suggestion to incorporate in the Army Annual Bill one of
    Dora's most stringent regulations for the prevention of
    criticism upon military matters aroused much indignation. Mr.
    BEN TILLETT observed that, if it were retained, Lord
    NORTHCLIFFE, Mr. BOTTOMLEY and even Sir HENRY DALZIEL might
    soon be conducting their various journals from a prison-cell.
    This possibility may have mitigated but it did not wholly
    remove the objections to the clause, which Mr. CHURCHILL
    ultimately withdrew.</p>

             Transportation)</i>. "ERIC&mdash;NAUGHTY!"
    </div>

    <p>A debate on the popular theme, "Make Germany Pay!" was
    initiated by Col. CLAUDE LOWTHER, who not long ago produced a
    specific scheme for extracting twenty-five thousand millions
    from the enemy&mdash;a scheme which by its unconventional
    handling of the rules of arithmetic excited the amazed
    admiration of professional financiers. Possibly Mr. BONAR LAW,
    as ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, was jealous because he had
    not thought of it first. At any rate he subjected the plan to
    so much caustic criticism that Col. LOWTHER, having appealed in
    vain for the protection of his namesake in the Chair, walked
    out of the House.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, April 3rd</i>.&mdash;Some of NAPOLEON'S many
    complaints of his treatment at St. Helena concerned the cost
    and quality of his food. The exile of Amerongen need have no
    fears on that score should the Allies decide to remove him to
    Longwood, for the present Governor has been so successful in
    keeping down the price of foodstuffs that the merchants of the
    island have petitioned for his recall.</p>

    <p>The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER has so far relaxed his
    <i>non-possumus</i> attitude on the joint income-tax question
    as to consent to receive a deputation of Members interested,
    and even to allow them to be accompanied by a small number of
    ladies. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, by the way, has exchanged his
    hereditary monocle for a pair of ordinary spectacles, which may
    account for his taking a less one-sided view of this
    question.</p>

    <p>Mr. T.P. O'CONNOR now enjoys the distinction of being the
    "Father" of the House of Commons, having sat there
    uninterruptedly since the General Election of 1880. Perhaps his
    new dignity sits rather heavily on his youthful spirit, for his
    speech on the Irish Estimates was painfully lugubrious. He took
    some comfort from a statement in <i>The Times</i> that "We are
    all Home Rulers now," but as a veteran journalist he is
    probably aware that what <i>The Times</i> says to-day it will
    not necessarily say to-morrow.</p>

    <p>"Leave politics alone and give us decent houses for our
    people and better education for our children" was Sir EDWARD
    CARSON'S prescription for invalid Erin; and Mr. IAN MACPHERSON,
    making his first speech as Chief Secretary, indicated that he
    meant to apply it. But the patient is suffering from so many
    disorders at present that she must have a tonic&mdash;with iron
    in it&mdash;before her Constitution can be regarded as
    completely restored.</p>

    <h2>MACEDONIA.</h2>

    <p>The Allies having won the War, and myself having been
    released from the hands of the Hun, I spent a happy
    repatriation leave, and began to think about soldiering again.
    My orders were to rejoin my reserve unit in the North of
    England.</p>

    <p>Before the time came, however, a friend of mine, an
    educational staff officer in Ireland, wrote to me and suggested
    that I should go over and give him the assistance of my
    superior intelligence. I replied that I would be delighted. He
    then wrote:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My dear K&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;I am so pleased that you are
    willing to come over to Macedonia and help us. You had better
    ask War Office for a week's extension of leave, by which time
    my application for you will probably have filtered through.
    That will save you the trouble of rejoining your reserve
    unit."</p>

    <p>I thought this an excellent plan and went to the War Office
    to see about it.</p>

    <p>After the customary wait I was granted a few moments of a
    Staff Officer's precious time.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" said the Staff Officer. He seemed used
    to meeting people who wanted things, and familiarity had
    evidently bred contempt.</p>

    <p>I humbly explained.</p>

    <p>"Have you got a written authority to support your
    application?" he asked.</p>

    <p>I produced my friend's letter, which was endorsed with the
    stamp of his Command Headquarters.</p>

    <p>The Staff Officer, standing (not out of politeness, I am
    sure), read the letter. Then he looked up, suspicion in his eye
    and in the cock of his head.</p>

    <p>"I don't understand this," he said. "You told me you wanted
    to go to Ireland. This letter distinctly refers to your going
    to Macedonia."</p>

    <p>"Macedonia!" I echoed (I had forgotten my friend's Biblical
    way of expressing himself).</p>

    <p>"Yes, Macedonia," snapped the Staff Officer. "Balkans, isn't
    it? Something to do with Salonika?"</p>

    <p>"Macedonia!" I repeated, still mystified.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;Macedonia," he snapped, obviously suspecting
    me of trying to obtain a week's leave on false pretences. "Here
    it is, in black and white, 'so pleased that you are willing to
    come <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"
       id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> over to Macedonia and help
       us.' I don't understand this at all."</p>

    <p>He handed me the letter. Then I realised what was amiss. My
    friend had not reckoned with the War Office. They call a spade
    a spade in Whitehall (unless they refer to it as "shovels,
    one.")</p>

    <p>"Oh," said I, "I see. Yes, Macedonia. Slight
    misunderstanding. It's written from Ireland all right. There's
    the Irish Command stamp on it. 'Come over to Macedonia and help
    us.' Biblical phrase. St. PAUL, you know. Just a figure of
    speech. My friend meant it metaphorically."</p>

    <p>"The devil he did," barked the Staff man. "Then why the
    blazes didn't he say so?"</p>

    <p>Of course, why didn't he say so? Very stupid of him. One
    can't be too literal in dealing with the War Office, that
    notorious fount of clear and orderly diction.</p>

    <p>My plan nearly went West, and I was nearly sent East. It was
    only the Headquarters' stamp that turned the scale in my
    favour.</p>

    <p>It was lucky for my friend that I ultimately got leave to
    help him in his educational duties. Cleanly he is himself sadly
    lacking in the very rudiments of official culture.</p>

    <h2>"BOTCHES."</h2>

    <h3>AN APPEAL FOR GOD-PARENTS.</h3>

    <p>For many years the village of Chailey, in
    Sussex&mdash;famous topographically for possessing that conical
    tree which is said to mark the centre of the county, and for a
    landmark windmill of dazzling whiteness&mdash;has been famous
    sociologically for its Heritage Craft Schools of crippled boys
    and girls. Among the ameliorative institutions of this country
    none has a finer record than these schools, where ever since
    1897 the work of converting helplessness into helpfulness has
    been going bravely on. Entering as complete dependents, the
    inmates leave fully equipped to earn their living unassisted,
    the boys chiefly as carpenters, and the girls as needlewomen.
    In some cases the cures effected have been remarkable. In the
    late War seven-and-twenty Guild boys fought in the ranks, four
    of whom were killed and are now proudly commemorated on the
    wall of the School church.</p>

    <p>This contribution of fighting men, together with a certain
    activity in munition-making, is not, however, Chailey's only
    share in the War, for the Government are using its experience
    for the education of cripples of a larger growth. The boys
    have, in short, surrendered their comfortable old
    quarters&mdash;now transferred to a War Hospital, named, after
    the Heritage's chief patron, the Princess Louise Special
    Military Surgical Hospital&mdash;to companies of maimed
    soldiers, who are sent to Chailey to learn how much of
    usefulness and fun can still remain when limbs are missing;
    and, by a charming inspiration, their teachers in this great
    lesson are the boys themselves. It is no doubt encouraging for
    a soldier who has lost both arms to be told by a kindly and
    enthusiastic visitor at his bedside that all will be well, and
    he will be able to manage without them; but a certain measure
    of scepticism and despair may remain to darken his waking
    hours. But when a little fellow in precisely the same plight
    shows him how the disabilities have been conquered, his zest in
    life begins to return. Seeing is believing, and believing means
    new endeavour. The result is that the crippled soldiers at
    Chailey, taught by the crippled boys, have been transformed
    into happy and active men, and not a few of them have
    discovered themselves to possess faculties of which they had no
    notion. There is even an armless billiard-player among them;
    and I could not wish him a happier setting for the exercise of
    his skill. For here is one of the finest Y.M.C.A. recreation
    halls in the country, with a view of the South Downs that
    probably no other can boast. Whether or not the method of
    learning from a young cripple the art of being an old one is
    novel, I cannot say, but it has been proved to be eminently
    successful; and one of its attractions is the pride taken not
    only in their mature pupils by the immature masters but in the
    boys by the men.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, what became of the boys whose nest was thus
    invaded? (The Girls' School and Babies' Montessori School is
    half-a-mile away.) They immediately showed what they are made
    of by themselves erecting on the ground beside the windmill a
    series of Kitchener huts. There they sleep and eat, coming
    hobbling down to headquarters for carpentering and to perform
    their strange new duties as guides, philosophers and
    friends.</p>

    <p>Another development in the Chailey scheme of altruism that
    arose from the War was, as readers of <i>Punch</i> will no
    doubt remember, the sudden establishment of the St. Nicholas
    Home for child victims of the air-raids. So sudden was it that
    within seven days of the inception of the idea a house had been
    found and furnished, a staff engaged and a number of the beds
    were occupied. Here, throughout the last years of the War,
    terrified children were soothed back to serenity and a sense of
    security in the sky above.</p>

    <p>And now for "Botches." It had long been one of the many
    aspirations of the founder of the Heritage Schools, and the
    founder also of the Guild of Brave Poor Things and the Guild of
    Play&mdash;Mrs. C.W. KIMMINS&mdash;who in her quiet practical
    way is probably as good a friend as London ever had&mdash;it
    had long been one of her dreams that the word "cripple" should
    be enlarged from its narrower meaning to include the crippled
    mind no less than the crippled limbs. In her work in Southwark,
    where the Guild of the Brave Poor Things began, she has seen
    too many children stunted and enfeebled by lack of pure food
    and fresh air, who would under better conditions grow naturally
    into health and strength and even power: "little mothers" taxed
    beyond their capacity by thoughtless parents, and all the other
    types of "cripple" which the mean streets of a great city can
    only too easily produce. If a house at Chailey or near by could
    be found or built where this wasted material might be nourished
    into happy efficiency, how splendid! Such was the desire of the
    founder, and it is now within sight of fruition; for, through
    the generosity of a friend of the Heritage, the house has been
    acquired and is ready for occupation.</p>

    <p>Strange are the vicissitudes of fortune; stranger the links
    in the chain of life. CLAUDE and ALICE ASKEW, who wrote popular
    serial novels in the daily papers, lived in a rambling old home
    at Wivelsfield Green, in Sussex, known as "Botches." This they
    enlarged and modernised; they developed the gardens and filled
    the grass with bulbs. Then came the War. Mr. and Mrs. ASKEW
    threw themselves into foreign work, and on one of their voyages
    were drowned through an enemy torpedo, and "Botches" became
    tenantless. It is "Botches" which has now been given to the
    Heritage for the reception of Southwark children.</p>

    <p>For the peopling and maintenance of the Home a novel and
    very pretty device has been invented. Everyone has heard of the
    <i>marraines</i> of France during the War&mdash;those ladies
    who made themselves responsible each for the comfort of a
    <i>poilu</i>, sending him gifts of food and cigarettes, writing
    him letters and so forth. It is the <i>marraine</i>&mdash;or
    godmother&mdash;system which is being adopted and adapted for
    "Botches." The house can accommodate fifty children, and as
    many godmothers or godfathers are needed, each of whom will be
    responsible <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"
       id="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span> for one child for a year,
       at a minimum cost of fifty pounds. The Duchess of
       MARLBOROUGH, who has just been elected a Southwark County
       Councillor, was the first to accept this honourable
       privilege, and other ladies and gentlemen have already
       joined her; but there are still many vacancies. Mr. Punch,
       who has very great pleasure in giving publicity to Mrs.
       KIMMINS'S most admirable scheme, would be proud indeed if
       the other godparents were found among his readers. All
       communications on the subject should be addressed to the
       Hon. Treasurer, Miss A.C. RENNIE, the Heritage Craft
       Schools, Chailey, Sussex.</p>

    <p>"Botches," it should be added, is not to be the Home's final
    name. The final name&mdash;something descriptive of the work
    before it and its ideal of restoration&mdash;has yet to be
    found. Perhaps some of Mr. Punch's readers have
    suggestions.</p>

    <h2>A FIRST-CLASS MISDEMEANANT.</h2>

    <p>Cozens has a conscience&mdash;a conformist
    conscience&mdash;and is a first-class season-ticket holder.</p>

    <p>The other morning we were travelling up to town together as
    usual. He was evidently bursting with the anticipatory pride of
    telling me something very much to his credit. Presently, at a
    gap in my reading, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I left my season at home this morning, so I bought a
    return."</p>

    <p>"What on earth for?" I expostulated. "You've already paid
    the company once by taking out a season; why pay twice? And
    anyhow it's only the Government."</p>

    <p>"It's the first duty of a citizen to obey the laws of his
    country," he proclaimed sententiously.</p>

    <p>"Oh, all right; but you'll never get your money
    back&mdash;not from the Government. Besides, you could easily
    have got through without a ticket."</p>

    <p>"How?"</p>

    <p>"By taking out your note-case at the barrier and showing the
    girl the back of a Bradbury. Dazzled by the display of so much
    wealth, she'd pass you without a murmur."</p>

    <p>"A miserable subterfuge," Cozens protested.</p>

    <p>"Or you and I might walk up to the barrier deep in
    conversation. I should then get in front, and the examiner
    would pull me up for my ticket. I should fumble before
    producing my season. Meantime you would have passed beyond
    recall."</p>

    <p>"I simply couldn't do it."</p>

    <p>"Or why not pay at the barrier, if you <i>must</i> pay?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, and lose the return ticket rate. How should I get down
    to-night?"</p>

    <p>"That's easy. Buy a platform ticket. The man at the gate at
    home will pass you; he knows you."</p>

    <p>"All underhand work," said Cozens. "It's much more dignified
    to buy a ticket."</p>

    <p>Just then a travelling inspector entered our carriage.</p>

    <p>"Tickets, gentlemen, please!"</p>

    <p>And Cozens, looking supremely undignified, produced a
    third-class return, and tried to explain.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>MR. COMPTON MACKENZIE gives us in <i>Sylvia and Michael</i>
    (SECKER) a continuation&mdash;I hesitate to say a
    conclusion&mdash;of the adventures of that amazing heroine,
    <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i>, which, being not a sequel but a second
    volume, needs some familiarity with the first for its full
    enjoyment. Not that anyone even meeting <i>Sylvia</i> for the
    first time in mid-course could fail to be intrigued by the
    astounding things that are continually happening to her. The
    variety and piquancy of these events and the general brilliance
    of Mr. MACKENZIE'S colouring must keep the reader alert,
    curious, scandalized (perhaps), but always expectant. His
    scheme starts with an invigorating plunge (as one might say,
    off the deep end) into the cabaret society of Petrograd in
    1914, where <i>Sylvia</i> and the more than queer company at
    the pension of <i>M&egrave;re Gontran</i> are surprised by the
    outbreak of war. Incidentally, <i>M&egrave;re Gontran</i>
    herself, with her cats, whose tails wave in the gloom "like
    seaweed," and her tawdry spiritualism&mdash;"key-hole peeping
    at infinity" the heroine (or the author) rather happily calls
    it&mdash;is one of the least forgettable figures in the galaxy.
    I have no space to indicate what turns of this glittering
    kaleidoscope eventually bring <i>Sylvia</i> and <i>Michael</i>
    together during the Serbian retreat, though there are scenes
    upon which I should like to dwell, notably that of the death of
    <i>Guy Hazlewood</i>, an incident whose admirable restraint
    shows Mr. MACKENZIE at his best. One question I have to ask,
    and that is how has <i>Sylvia</i> learnt to imitate so
    bewilderingly the mannerisms of <i>Michael</i>? Her soliloquies
    especially might have come straight from the first volume of
    <i>Sinister Street</i>, so much more do they suggest the
    cloistered adolescence of Carlington Road than a development
    from her own feverish youth. While I cannot pretend that she
    has for me the compelling vitality of <i>Jenny Pearl</i>, her
    adventures certainly make (for those who are not too nice about
    the morals or the conversation of their company) an
    exhilarating, even intoxicating entertainment, the end of which
    is, I am glad to think, still remote.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The publishers, in their preface to Mr. HUGH SPENDER'S new
    novel, <i>The Seekers</i> (COLLINS), led me to believe that it
    was written with the object of denouncing the dangers and the
    frauds of spiritualism. This, however, is by no means the case.
    To be sure the first few chapters do contain an account of a
    <i>s&eacute;ance</i>, which serves not so much to lay bare the
    mysteries of spiritualism as to bring together a few of the
    characters in the novel. From that point onward there is
    nothing more about spooks, save for an occasional reference. It
    is when the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> have been well
    collected in and about a Yorkshire vicarage that things really
    get a move on and begin to hum. No reader is entitled to
    complain of a lack of excitement; the mortality, indeed, is
    almost Shakspearean. <i>Rudge</i>, a medium, who must not be
    confused with our old friend, <i>Mr. Sludge</i>, perishes in a
    snowstorm. <i>John Havering</i> batters in the head of
    <i>Hubert Kenyon</i>, and later on commits suicide, while
    <i>Beaufort</i>, a Labour leader, is wrongfully charged with
    the murder of <i>Hubert</i> and barely escapes with his life.
    Everything however ends comparatively well, owing to a strong
    female interest. Mr. SPENDER is usually a careful workman, but
    sometimes his sentences get the better of him. Here is one
    such: "She wondered if Peter, who must have seen Mary as he
    came into the vicarage disappear into the study, had gone in,
    hoping to find her there as he left the house." It is not often
    however that Mr. SPENDER leaves his clauses to fight it out
    together like that.</p>

       id="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span>

    <p>In <i>The Golden Rope</i> (LANE) Mr. J.W. BRODIE-INNES has
    tried to combine a tale of mystery and murder with the
    love-story of a man of fifty; and, on the whole, it is a fairly
    successful effort. <i>Alan Maclean</i>, the middle-aged one,
    who tells the tale, was a celebrated artist, and, when he made
    his way to Devon to paint Pontylanyon Castle, he little
    expected to find himself involved in a maze of intrigue and
    adventure. The castle, however, was owned by a lady of great
    but unfortunate possessions. In the first place she had a dual
    personality (and, believe me, it is the very deuce to have a
    dual personality); and, secondly, she possessed a crowd of
    relatives (Austrian) who wanted her estate and were ready to
    remove mountains and men to get it. I know nothing of <i>Mr.
    Maclean's</i> pictures except that I am assured by the author
    that they were exquisitely beautiful, but I do know that Mr.
    INNES'S own canvas suffers from overcrowding, and, although I
    admire the deft way in which he handles his embarrassment of
    figures, his task would have been less complicated and my
    enjoyment more complete if he had managed to do with fewer.
    Otherwise I can recommend <i>The Golden Hope</i> both for its
    exciting episodes, lavish of thrills, and for the warning it
    gives to men of fifty to stick to their pigments, or whatever
    their stock-in-trade may be.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Cinderella Man</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON), "a romance
    of youth," by HELEN and EDWARD CARPENTER, is more suited to the
    ingenuous than the sophisticated reader. Its hero is a poet,
    <i>Tony Quintard</i>, very poor and deathly proud. The scene is
    set in New York and largely in <i>Tony's</i> attic
    verse-laboratory, which <i>Marjorie</i>, the rugged
    millionaire's daughter, visits by way of the leads in a
    perfectly proper if unconventional mood. The idiom occasionally
    soars into realms even higher. Thus when <i>Tony's</i> father
    dies he is "summoned, by the Great Usher of Eternity." When the
    gentle <i>Marjorie</i>, reading out one of <i>Tony's</i>
    efforts&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Love whose feet are shod with light</p>

            <p>Lost this ribbon in her flight;</p>

            <p>Rosette of the twilight sky,</p>

            <p>Waft to me Love's lullaby!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>(the note of exclamation is <i>Tony's</i>), says, "Anyone
    who can write songs like that ought to write an opera," you
    realise that her heart is sounder than her pretty head. Anyway
    <i>Tony</i>, who needed no encouragement, wrote his opera and
    landed a ten-thousand dollar prize for same, together with the
    daughter of the millionaire, who began to see, no doubt, that
    there might be something in poetry after all.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Indian Studies</i> (HUTCHINSON) one may call a work
    partly descriptive and historical, partly also polemic. Its
    author, General Sir O'MOORE CARAGH, V.C. (and so many other
    letters of honour that there is hardly room for them on the
    title page), writes with the powerful authority of forty years'
    Indian service, five of them as Commander-in-Chief. His book
    is, in compressed form, a survey of the Indian Empire that
    deserves the epithet "exhaustive"; history, races, religious
    castes and forms of local government are all intimately
    surveyed; the chapters on the India Office and (especially) the
    army in India will command wide attention both among experts
    and the general public. Naturally the word "experts" brings me
    to the controversial side of the subject, the much discussed
    Montagu-Chelmsford Report, concerning which the late C.-in-C.
    holds views that might fairly be described as pronounced. Where
    authorities differ the honest reviewer can but record
    impartially. Really we have here the old antagonism between the
    upholder of one school of Imperial thought, fortified by many
    years' experience of it's successful application, and the
    theories of a newer and more experimental age. Without
    attempting a judgment on its conclusions, I can safely agree
    with the publishers that this is a book that "will be read with
    special interest in military, diplomatic and Government
    circles"; also&mdash;my own postscript&mdash;more vociferously
    debated in certain club smoking-rooms than almost any volume of
    recent years.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A "Literary Note" thoughtfully inserted in the fly-leaves of
    <i>The Elstones</i> (HUTCHINSON) informs me that it will "make
    a strong appeal to all those who have experienced the suffering
    caused by religious conflict." It is not entirely because it
    has been my lot to escape the ordeal in question that Miss
    ISABEL C. CLARKE'S latest book failed to make the promised
    appeal. She takes two hundred and odd pages of peculiarly
    eye-racking type to convert the <i>Elstone</i> family to
    Catholicism without indicating in any way how or why her solemn
    puppets are inspired to change their beliefs. Now and again a
    completely nebulous cleric happens along to perform the
    necessary function of receiving a moribund neophyte into the
    Church; otherwise the conversion appears to take place as it
    were by spontaneous combustion and not as the result of any
    visible proselytising agency. However the <i>Elstones</i> bear
    no resemblance to real human beings&mdash;you can hardly expect
    it of people called <i>Ierne</i> and <i>Magali</i> and
    <i>Ivo</i> and <i>Elvidia</i> and names like that&mdash;so
    perhaps it doesn't matter how they came to see the great light.
    The important thing obviously from the authoress's point of
    view is to get them into the fold; and good Catholics who look
    at the end rather than the means may enjoy <i>The Elstones</i>.
    As a novel it will try them hard.</p>

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
